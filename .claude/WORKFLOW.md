# Claude Code Development Workflow
**Single Source of Truth - Read this at the start of each session**

---

## Quick Reference

**Current Project:** {YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}
**Main Branch:** `main`
**Branch Pattern:** `feature/{issue-number}--{description}` or `fix/{issue-number}--{description}`
**Test Command:** `{YOUR_TEST_COMMAND}` (must pass before PR)
**Automation Script:** `./.claude/hooks/post-summary.sh`

---

## Complete Development Workflow

### 1. Start Work on an Issue

```bash
# Run the start-work script
./scripts/start-work.sh {issue-number}

# This automatically:
# - Creates feature branch: feature/{issue-number}--{description}
# - Switches to that branch
# - Ready to start coding
```

**Branch Naming:**
- ✅ `feature/16--feature-add-pagination-to-tas`
- ✅ `fix/25--fix-validation-error`
- ❌ `my-feature-branch` (no issue number)

---

### 2. Implementation Phase

**Standard Process:**

1. **Read Requirements** - Understand the issue/acceptance criteria
2. **Plan** - Use TodoWrite tool to track tasks if complex (3+ steps)
3. **Implement** - Write code following best practices
4. **Test** - Ensure all tests pass (`{YOUR_TEST_COMMAND}`)
5. **Commit** - Detailed commit messages
6. **Post Comment** - Document progress on GitHub

**When to Post Comments:**

Post a comment after every **milestone commit**:
- ✅ Feature implementation completed
- ✅ Bug fix completed and tested
- ✅ Significant refactoring done
- ✅ Test suite updated and passing
- ❌ Don't post for tiny changes or WIP commits

---

- src/models/Task.js (pagination logic)
- src/middleware/validation.js (validatePagination)
- src/controllers/taskController.js (metadata)
- tests/tasks.test.js (14 new tests)

**Testing:**
- All 32 tests passing
- Verified backward compatibility

### 4. Post Progress Comments

**CRITICAL:** Always run after milestone commits!

**Two Formats Available:**

**Format 1: Standard (2 parameters) - Backward Compatible**
```bash
./.claude/hooks/post-summary.sh \
  "What you asked Claude to do (formatted request)" \
  "What was achieved (detailed, structured)"
```

**Format 2: With Actual Prompt (3 parameters) - NEW**
```bash
./.claude/hooks/post-summary.sh \
  "raw user prompt exactly as typed" \
  "Formatted request description with context" \
  "What was achieved (detailed, structured)"
```

**ACTUAL_PROMPT (Parameter 1 - Optional):**
- Raw, verbatim user input
- Example: "add comments to all files"
- Shows ≤3 lines: Displayed directly
- Shows >3 lines: Collapsed with "View full prompt" button

**USER_PROMPT (Parameter 2 in 3-param format, Parameter 1 in 2-param):**
- ❌ Bad: "Implement pagination"
- ✅ Good: "Implement pagination for GET /api/tasks endpoint (Issue #16)"
- ✅ Better: "Fix critical bug in post-summary.sh preventing file list from appearing in GitHub comments"

**ACHIEVEMENT (Parameter 3 in 3-param format, Parameter 2 in 2-param):**

Must be detailed and structured. See template below.

**Achievement Template:**

   - Modified Task.findAll() to accept pagination options
   - Added deterministic sorting (createdAt DESC, ID DESC)
   - Added Task.count() method

2. Validation Middleware (src/middleware/validation.js:186-217)
   - Created validatePagination with express-validator
   - Page: positive integer >= 1
   - Limit: 1-100 (max enforced for security)

3. Controller (src/controllers/taskController.js:81-125)
   - Calculates pagination metadata
   - Two response formats (with/without pagination)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
✅ Query params accepted
✅ Validation enforced
✅ Metadata returned
✅ All tests passing (32/32)

**Testing:**
- All 32 tests passing
- 14 new pagination tests added

**Result:**

)"
```

**CRITICAL: After PR created, do NOT post a ClaudeCode Update comment immediately!**

The PR description IS the summary. Update comments are ONLY for changes made AFTER code review.

**Correct Workflow After PR Creation:**

1. ✅ PR created with comprehensive description (includes "@claude review it" in description)
2. ✅ Post initial comment to trigger review: `gh pr comment {PR_NUM} --body "@claude review it"`
3. ⏳ Wait for @claude to post review comments
4. 🔧 Make changes based on review feedback
5. ✅ Commit changes
6. ✅ Push changes
7. ✅ **THEN** post ClaudeCode Update comment (automatically includes "@claude review it")

**Note:** GitHub @mentions work in comments, not PR descriptions. The initial "@claude review it" comment triggers the first review, and subsequent updates via post-summary.sh automatically trigger reviews.

**Wrong Workflow:**
1. ❌ Create PR
2. ❌ Immediately post ClaudeCode Update #1 (duplicate/unnecessary!)
3. ❌ Creates confusion

**When to Use post-summary.sh for PRs:**

```bash
# ONLY use after making changes from review feedback
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address review feedback..."
git push

# NOW post update comment (automatically triggers @claude review)
./.claude/hooks/post-summary.sh \
  "Address code review feedback from @claude" \
  "Fixed issues identified in review..."
```

**Automatic @claude Review:**
- Every PR update comment automatically includes "@claude review it"
- This triggers automatic code review after each change
- No need to manually mention @claude in comments

**After PR created:**
- Future change comments go to **PR only** (not Issue)
- Use post-summary.sh only when pushing changes after review
- Don't post immediately after PR creation
- Each update automatically triggers @claude review

### 7. Cleanup After Merge

```bash
# Run cleanup script (switches to main, pulls, deletes branch)
./scripts/cleanup-after-merge.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Switches to main branch
2. Pulls latest changes
3. Deletes feature branch locally

---

## Automation System

### How It Works

**Branch → Issue/PR Mapping:**

The script extracts the issue number from your current branch name:
```
feature/16--description → Posts to Issue #16
feature/25--description → Posts to Issue #25
```

**Multiple Issues:**
Switch branches to work on different issues:
```bash
git checkout feature/10-task-one
./.claude/hooks/post-summary.sh "..." "..."  # → Posts to Issue #10

git checkout feature/15-task-two
./.claude/hooks/post-summary.sh "..." "..."  # → Posts to Issue #15
```

**Session Tracking:**

Counters stored in `.claude/session-counter.json`:
```json
{
  "issue-16": 3,
  "pr-11": 2
}
```

Each Issue and PR has independent sequential numbering.

### Enable/Disable Automation

```bash
# Disable
export DISABLE_AUTO_COMMENT=true

# Enable
unset DISABLE_AUTO_COMMENT
```

📖 **Detailed Guide:** See `AUTOMATION-FAQ.md` for complete Q&A

---

## Git Workflow

### Files to Ignore

These are automatically ignored (`.gitignore`):
- `.claude/session-counter.json` - Local session tracking
- `.claude-prompt-*.md` - Conversation logs
- `docs/dev-logs/` - Development logs

**Never commit these!** They're local-only files.

### Working Tree Management

**Before committing:**
```bash
git status  # Should be clean or only show intended changes
```

**If you see unexpected files:**
- Session counter, prompt logs → Already ignored, safe to skip
- Other files → Verify they should be committed

### Push Timing

**Before PR:**
- Work locally, commit often
- Don't push to remote yet
- Post comments to Issue

**After PR created:**
- Push changes to remote
- Comments now go to PR
- Continue iterating

---

## Testing Requirements

### Before Every Commit

```bash
{YOUR_TEST_COMMAND}
```

**Must pass:** All tests must pass before committing.

**If tests fail:**
1. Fix the issues
2. Re-run tests
3. Only commit when green

### Test Coverage

```bash
# Run with coverage
{YOUR_TEST_COMMAND} -- --coverage
```

Coverage data automatically included in comments if available.

**Thresholds:**
- Target: 80%+ coverage
- Files below 80% flagged in comments

---

## Common Commands Quick Reference

```bash
# Start work
./scripts/start-work.sh {issue-number}

# Check status
git status

# Run tests
{YOUR_TEST_COMMAND}

# Commit (use heredoc for long messages)
git add .
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
{detailed commit message}
EOF
)"

# Post comment
./.claude/hooks/post-summary.sh \
  "Request description" \
  "Achievement details"

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."

# Cleanup after merge
./scripts/cleanup-after-merge.sh
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Cleanup script fails with uncommitted files

**Symptoms:**
```
error: cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes.
.claude/session-counter.json
.claude-prompt-issue-16.md
docs/dev-logs/issue-16.md
```

**Solution:**
These files are already in `.gitignore`. Just commit your actual work:
```bash
git add {your-actual-files}
git commit -m "..."
```

The ignored files won't cause issues - they're local only.

### Issue: File list not appearing in GitHub comments

**Symptoms:**
Comment shows "8 files modified" but list is empty.

**Solution:**
This was a bash subshell bug, now fixed in post-summary.sh.
If you encounter this, it means you're on an old version of the script.

### Issue: Tests failing

**Symptoms:**
```
{YOUR_TEST_COMMAND}
# Some tests fail
```

**Solution:**
1. Read the error messages carefully
2. Fix the failing tests or code
3. Re-run tests
4. Only commit when all pass

### Issue: Can't determine which issue to post to

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ No issue or PR found
```

**Solution:**
Your branch name doesn't match the pattern. Must be:
- `feature/{number}--{description}`
- `fix/{number}--{description}`

Check: `git branch --show-current`

### Issue: Multiple @claude reviews from one comment

**Symptoms:**
Single PR update comment triggers 2-3 @claude reviews instead of just one.

**Root Cause:**
Commit messages containing "@claude" (or other @mentions) trigger GitHub notifications.
When the commit list is displayed in comments, each @mention triggers a review.

**Solution:**
The script automatically escapes @mentions in commit messages by adding a space:
- `@claude` becomes `@ claude` (won't trigger notification)
- Commit history remains readable
- Only the final "@claude review it" triggers a review

**Prevention:**
Avoid using @mentions in commit messages. If you accidentally do, the script will
automatically escape them when displaying the commit list.

## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Read this file at the start of each session
✅ Run tests before every commit
✅ Post detailed comments after milestone commits
✅ Use TodoWrite for complex tasks (3+ steps)
✅ Follow commit message format
✅ Reference specific files and line numbers in comments
✅ Explain WHY, not just WHAT
✅ Keep working tree clean
✅ Use 3-parameter format for post-summary.sh when you have the raw user prompt
✅ Let script auto-escape @mentions in commits (it does this automatically)

### DON'T:
❌ Skip testing before commits
❌ Write one-sentence comments
❌ Commit without running post-summary.sh (after milestones)
❌ Create PRs with failing tests
❌ Push before creating PR
❌ Commit .claude/session-counter.json or prompt logs
❌ Use vague commit messages
❌ Use @mentions in commit messages (creates duplicate reviews if you do)
